                This is the second release of DNA. This release
                introduces several bug fixes and feature enhancements.
                The primary purpose of this release is the introduction
                of a high level User Guide. The release can be downloaded
                from;

                <li>
                    Fixed a bug in SAXConfigurationHandler that could cause a
                    ArrayStoreException using some parsers. Some parsers would
                    not pass the ContentHandler text content if it would be
                    removed during normalization of the XML document. The DNA
                    code did not expect this behaviour but has since been fixed
                    and unit test added to avoid regression.
