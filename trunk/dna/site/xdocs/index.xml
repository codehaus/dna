            DNA is a lightweight Inversion of Control (IOC) framework. It defines the
            way that you write components so that they can be hosted in DNA-compliant
            containers.
	    </p>
        <p>
            DNA has gone through three major revisions. The first version of DNA
            (1.0) defined the programming contract for DNA-compliant components.
            Version 1.1 of DNA tightened the programming contract and defined the
            information model for metadata associated with components. The metadata
            was bound to the components using the <a href="http://metaclass.codehaus.org">
            MetaClass</a> toolkit. Version 1.2 of DNA uses the JDK 1.5
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">Annotation</a>
            framework to bind the metadata to the components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each revision has seen the development of DNA-compliant components
            simplified and we recomend you upgrade to the latest DNA version.
            However we recognize that not all users are ready to use JDK 1.5 and
            thus we still maintain the <a href="1.1/index.html">version 1.1 of
            DNA</a>.
