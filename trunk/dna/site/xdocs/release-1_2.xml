            <p>
                This is the third release of DNA. The primary purpose of
                this release is the replacement of MetaClass with JDK1.5
                Annotation framework.

            <ul>
                <li>
                	Remove MetaClass dependency and replace with dependency
                    on JDK1.5 Annotation framework. This resulted in removal
                    of significant amount of code from the dna-tools project.
                    The code removal included removing all code that processed
                    and validated MetaClass Attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Migrate the ComponentVerifier class from the <code>org.codehaus.dna.tools</code>
                    package to the <code>org.codehaus.dna.impl.verifier</code> package.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removal of the dna-tools project including the maven plugin
                    as it no contained any code. The MetaClass code was removed and
                    the verifier code was moved to the dna-impl project.
