                A container may support features beyond and above standard DNA
                lifecycle processing. These container extensions are given an
                identifier and this allows components to refer to specific
                extensions and
                <a href="model.html#ExtensionDescriptorSet">declare</a>
                their compatibility with the extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                Extension names are derived from the package name of the
                annotations that they support. For example, a container that
                supports the <code>com.biz.security.SecurityRole</code>
                implements the container extension <code>com.biz.security</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of container extensions can be broken down
                into two parts. Documenting and designing the metadata a component
                has to expose for container extension and implementing the container
                extension. The implementation of container extensions is beyond
                the scope of this document.
