                DNA components have associated metadata that declares what
                resources they need to be provided and what resources they are
                capable of providing to other components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically there has been several different mechanisms for
                associating metadata with a component. DNA attempts to learn
                from past mistakes and make the metadata format extensible to
                future needs and while still simple to use. To achieve this goal
                the JDK 1.5 <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">Annotation</a>
                framework has been used to enable runtime access of component
                metadata.

                The annotation framework means that a developer can annotate the
                source code of their components to define the metadata associated
                with the component. The annotations defined for the DNA framework
                are described in the <a href="model.html">MetaData Model</a>
                document.
