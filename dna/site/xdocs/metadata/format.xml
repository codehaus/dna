                Historically there has been several different mechanisms for
                associating metadata with a component. DNA attempts to learn
                from past mistakes and make the metadata format extensible to
                future needs and still simple to use. Thus runtime attribute
                access is the preferred method for accessing metadata about a
                component.

                <a href="http://spice.sf.net/metaclass">MetaClass</a> is the
                toolkit used to access the metadata about any java class. The
                MetaClass metadata format maps to a simplified JavaDoc format
                and thus there is a very simple mapping between the DNA
                metadata
                <a href="model.html">model</a> and MetaClass
                ClassDescriptor objects. See MetaClass documentation on how to
                access attributes at runtime.

            <p>
                MetaClass also supports generation of metadata descriptors from
                annotated Java source files. The annotations supported by DNA
                components are those specified in the
                <a href="model.html">model</a> document.
